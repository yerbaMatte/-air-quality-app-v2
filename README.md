# -air-quality-app-v2

Hello and welcome to the Air Quality App! 
The Air Quality App is a web application that provides real-time air quality data from around the world.

To build this app, I used a combination of technologies including:
React, 
Axios, 
Leaflet, 
React-Leaflet, 
Chart.js, 
moment.js
react-query

These technologies allow the app to fetch and display air quality data in an interactive and user-friendly way.

I hope you find this app useful and informative. 

Thank you for visiting, and please feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions you may have.
