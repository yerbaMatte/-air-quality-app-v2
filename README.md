# Air Quality App 🌤

Hello and welcome to the Air Quality App! 👋🏻
The Air Quality App is a web application that provides real-time air quality data from around the world.

🛠 To build this app, I used a combination of technologies including:
• React 
• Axios 
• Leaflet 
• React-Leaflet 
• Chart.js 
• moment.js
• react-query

These technologies allow the app to fetch and display air quality data in an interactive and user-friendly way.
Thank you for visiting, and please feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions you may have. 🙏🏼
