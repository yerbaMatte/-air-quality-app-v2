<h2># Air Quality App 🌤</h2>

<p>Hello and welcome to the Air Quality App! 👋🏻</p>
The Air Quality App is a web application that provides real-time air quality data from around the world.

<p>🛠 To build this app, I used a combination of technologies including:</p>
<ul>
<li>• React </li>
<li>• Axios </li>
<li>• Leaflet </li>
<li>• React-Leaflet </li>
<li>• Chart.js </li>
<li>• moment.js</li>
<li>• react-query</li>
<ul>

<p>These technologies allow the app to fetch and display air quality data in an interactive and user-friendly way.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting, and please feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions you may have. 🙏🏼</p>
